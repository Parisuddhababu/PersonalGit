## AutoComplete with Adding Chips & AutoComplete multi-level Dropdown & Multi-level checkbox selection

Autocomplete with Add Chips is a user interface pattern that combines an autocomplete input field with the ability to add selected items as chips or tags. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where users need to select multiple items from a predefined list or where free-form input is allowed, and the entered items are represented as discrete chips. In React.js, implementing autocomplete with add chips involves integrating a component that handles both the autocomplete functionality and the chip creation.

# Notes: Duplication issue of the sonarqube

- For Skill List & Company List, Filter List Data you need to un-comment the code but while actual development at that time you need to take data from api end only.
