**Overview:**
The `YoutubePlay` component is designed to create an engaging and interactive company overview section on a website. It includes a video preview, company information, and additional links. The video starts playing when it becomes visible in the viewport, enhancing the user experience. The section adapts its layout based on the screen width for a responsive design.

**Key Features:**

1. **Video Preview:**

   - The component includes a video preview using the `OurCompanyVideo` component.
   - The video plays automatically when it becomes visible in the viewport and pauses when it's not in view, providing an interactive and seamless experience.

2. **Responsive Design:**

   - The layout adjusts based on the screen width to ensure optimal viewing on different devices.
   - The company information and other links are arranged in a grid format for better organization.

3. **Company Header:**

   - The component displays a company header with a title and a description.

4. **Company Information:**

   - Company-specific information is presented in a graphical format.
   - Each piece of information includes a count and a corresponding title.

5. **Additional Links:**

   - Links to other pages or resources related to the company are displayed in a navigation menu.

6. **Conditional Header Display:**
   - The company header is displayed differently based on the screen width. On smaller screens (width <= 990 pixels), the header is shown above the video. On larger screens (width > 990 pixels), the header is displayed to the left of the video.

**How to Use:**

1. **Installation:**

   - Ensure that the required dependencies, utility functions (`uuid`), and icons are available in your project.

2. **Import Components:**
   - Import the `YoutubePlay` component in your project.

```javascript
import YoutubePlay from 'path/to/YoutubePlay';
```

3. **Pass Data to the Component:**
   - Provide the necessary data as props to the `YoutubePlay` component.

```typescript
const companyInfoData = {
  title: 'Our Company',
  description: 'Learn more about our company and what we do.',
  video_thumb_url: '/path/to/video-thumbnail.jpg',
  company_info: [
    { count: '100+', title: 'Employees' },
    { count: '50+', title: 'Projects Completed' },
    // Add more company info items as needed
  ],
  other_page_links: [
    { url: '/services', title: 'Our Services' },
    { url: '/contact', title: 'Contact Us' },
    // Add more links as needed
