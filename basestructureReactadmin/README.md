## 7. Component Management:

-   **Common Components** :-

    -   To separate functionality and make code more understandable, reusable, and manageable, we construct components for each functionality,

-   **Component Creation** :-
    -   First you need to create a new folder inside a views folder and need to make a component inside that component folder and always you need to take care about the component is re-usable.
